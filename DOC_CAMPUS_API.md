## ‚úÖ Notes

- All endpoints follow REST conventions.
- Path parameters like `{course_id}` and `{faculty_id}` are required and must be integers.
- Complex search and filtering use query parameters (e.g., `?query=data` or `?topics=ai`).
- Data is stored in JSON files (`courses.json`, `faculty.json`) and changes are saved automatically.
